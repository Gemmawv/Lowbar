# Lowbar
A reimplementation of several methods from the Underscore JS library complete with TDD.


# General setup
1. Make sure you have node installed. Open a terminal window and run:
``` javascript 
node -v
```
This command will tell you the version of node you have, if you have it installed already. If you do not have node installed, follow the installation instructions found here https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/.


2. Make sure you have npm installed. Open a terminal window and run:
``` javascript 
npm -v
```
This command will tell you the version of npm you have, if you have it installed already. If you do not have npm installed, first make sure you have node installed (as described above), then run:
``` javascript 
npm install npm
```
